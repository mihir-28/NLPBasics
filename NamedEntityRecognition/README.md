# Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories. These categories can include names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

For example, in the sentence "Apple Inc. is planning to open a new store in San Francisco on January 1, 2023", NER would identify "Apple Inc." as an organization, "San Francisco" as a location, and "January 1, 2023" as a date.

NER is widely used in many fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and semantic search, and it's crucial for building applications like chatbots, recommendation systems, and semantic analysis tools.
