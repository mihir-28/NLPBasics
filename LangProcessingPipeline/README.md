# Language Processing Pipeline

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline is a sequence of steps to transform raw text into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand. The typical steps are: text collection, cleaning, tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization, vectorization, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring/updating the model.
